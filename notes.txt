Implemented so far:
- (2) changing weapons
- (2) firing
- (2) health updating
- (1) auto lights - change this a bit
- (2) reloading a weapon




Observations:
- in order to have effective firing, there has to be a delay after calling the fire method to allow the animation to finish
- animations in general have strange behaviour



TODO:
- refactor and comment the methods I touched (especially the lights)
- reference the introduce lights to Gaius' github as a starting point
- get the bot find the aid pack and pick it up
- fix the beams
- jump/crouch
- refactot if statements to a switch statement in "void pyBotClass::interpretRemoteProcedureCall (char *data)" in pybot.cpp
