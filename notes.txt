Implemented so far:
- (2) changing weapons
- (2) firing
- (2) health updating
- (1) auto lights - change this a bit
- (2) reloading a weapon
- (2) jumping and crouching




Observations:
- in order to have effective firing, there has to be a delay after calling the fire method to allow the animation to finish
- animations in general have strange behaviour



TODO:
- (1&2) refactor and comment the methods I touched (especially the lights)

- (1) reference the "introduce lights" to Gaius' github as a starting point
      and refactor heavily. Also:
	- command line flag to choose the type of lights
	- make heavy changes

- (1) fix the beams. Also:
	- enable/disable beams from command line
	- 

- (2) get the bot find the aid pack and pick it up
	- write about getting a medkit from a list of available medkits
	  or only getting a single one. Problem of determining the closest
	  medkit if there are multiple on the map
	- this is too difficult to do, can't figure out how to get the medkit
	  location, or list of spawned medkits
