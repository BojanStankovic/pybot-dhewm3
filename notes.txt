Implemented so far:
- (2) changing weapons
- (2) firing
- (2) health updating
- (1) auto lights - maybe change this a bit
- (2) reloading a weapon




Observations:
- in order to have effective firing, there has to be a delay after calling the fire method to allow the animation to finish




TODO:
- refactor and comment the methods I touched (especially the lights)
- reference the introduce lights to Gaius' github
- get the bot find the aid pack and pick it up
- fix the beams
- reload weapons
